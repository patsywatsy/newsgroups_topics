# Topic Modelling the 20 Newsgroups Dataset


## Introduction

In an effort to develop a sample multilingual topic model applicable to multilingual document sets, we revisit BERTopics, a pipeline that integrates sentence transformers and embeddings to accomplish this task. The easily integrable sentence transformer models introduces the ability to utilize a number of pretrained models capable of vectorizing documents in non-English languages.

For the sake of this exercise, we'll be utilizing the 20 Newsgroups Dataset (said to be available in different languages; otherwise I'll find something to use).
